## How to run

1. You need to have at least Python3.6 installed. To do that, go to
https://www.python.org/downloads. Make sure to tick the box "Add Python to
Path"!
2. You need to install the wxPython GUI framework. To do that, open a command
prompt (search cmd in Windows, open a Terminal in Linux/Mac) and type in `pip
install wxpython`. This should work automatically.
3. Click on smb3-foundry.py and the editor should open up, asking you to
select the ROM you want to load. Preferably the US version of SMB3 or a Hack
based on it.
